The Fourth Paradigm
-------------------

* Computer infers the model from the data
    * "Machine learning" - nonlinear curve fitting
    * Optimise fit for training data

[Read the book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fourth-Paradigm-Data-Intensive-Scientific-Discovery/dp/0982544200/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)

Why it works
-----------------

* Theoretical advances in the mathematics of classification and regression
* Computers that are good at global optimisation in large spaces (GPUs)
* Disproportionate effectiveness of machine learning with huge datasets

Data Fundamentalism and the problems of Big Modelling
=====================================================

Weaknesses of the Third Paradigm
--------------------------------

* Huge parameter spaces
    * Glorified curve fitting
    * Without statistical rigour
    * Labour intensive parameter management

Weaknesses of the Third Paradigm
--------------------------------

* Computational expense
* Large result sets
    * Unwieldy meta-analysis
    * In-situ data reduction

Weaknesses of the Fourth Paradigm
---------------------------------

* Does not produce insight
    * Lack of traceability
    * Need for defensible and auditable machine decisions
* Problems with extrapolation: 'what if'.
* Prefers labelled examples (supervision)
    * Crowd sourcing?

The Détente
===========

Use what you know
-----------------

* Machine learned models with physically informed structure
    * Biological systems and the soft-switch

* Physical understanding as a prior in function space?

Machine assisted parameterisation
---------------------------------

* Use machine assistance to explore:
  * Parameterisation literature
  * DBs

Do inference with your models
-----------------------------

* Statistically rigorous approaches to parameter fitting and model selection
* Modelling with uncertainty
  * Stochastic programming

Do inference with your models
-----------------------------

* Fit simpler structures to your mechanistic models to save time
  * Need a rigorous approach to model run management
