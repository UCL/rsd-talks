Talks about tools and techniques that we think are interesting or important.

Software Carpentry: Compressed Edition
--------------------------------------

This talk is an introduction to [Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.org), a training course on
programming skills for researchers. The full syllabus takes two days, and is run regularly in UCL.
This talk provides a brief, one-hour introduction to the material, as a taster, to encourage people to
attend the full event.

Practical Version Control and Issue Tracking
--------------------------------------------

Version control is the most important professional software engineering tool for research,
allowing rigorous tracking of which version of software is used for which analysis or simulation. 
Its adoption is the first step which any research project should take in improving their research
progamming practices. This talk introduces the concepts of version control, common to the various
tools which are used by different labs.

Deployment with Fabric for HPC
------------------------------

If you manually ssh into a supercomputer and build the latest version of your code, and qsub
each job individually, you are doing it wrong. This talk explains how to use scripting tools such as
Fabric to automate the process of shipping your software to a cluster, running an analysis, and shipping
results back.
