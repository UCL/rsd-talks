Practical Version Control and Issue Tracking
============================================

What Version Control is For
---------------------------

* Managing Code Inventory
    * "When did I introduce this bug"?
    * Undoing Mistakes
* Working with other programmers
    * "How can I merge my work with Jim's"

What is version control?
------------------------

Do some programming

`my_vcs commit`

Program some more

Realise mistake

`my_vcs rollback`

Mistake is undone

What is version control? (Team version)
---------------------------------------

Sue                 James
------------------ ------
Create some code    
`my_vcs commit`     
                    Join the team
                    `my_vcs checkout`
                    do some programming
                    `my_vcs commit`
`my_vcs update`		more programming
Do some programming
					`my_vcs commit`
`my_vcs commit`
Oh Noes! Error!
`my_vcs update`
`my_vcs merge`
`my_vcs commit`
					`my_vcs commit`
					Error again...

Centralised Version Control
===========================

Centralised VCS concepts
------------------------

* There is one, linear history of changes on the server or **repository**
* Each revision has a unique, sequential identifier (1,2,3,4...)
* You have a **working copy**
* You **update** the working copy to match the state of the repository
* If someone else has changed the repository while you were working:
  * You update to get their changes
  * You have to **resolve conflicts**
  * Then you commit

Centralised VCS conflicted workflow
----------------------------------------
![Conflicted workflow for SVN](assets/centralised_team)

Resolving conflicts
-------------------

On update, you get a prompt like:
``` Bash
svn update
> Conflict discovered in ’sharedfile.py'. 
> Select: (p) postpone, (e) edit, (mc) mine-conflict ...
```

If you choose `(e)` the conflicted file will look something like:
``` Diff
Whatever was in the file before the conflicted bit
<<<<<<< .mine
Sue’s content
======= 
Jim’s content
>>>>>>> .r4
Content after the conflicted bit
```

It is your duty to edit this to fix conflicts, then save.

Revisiting history
------------------

Update to a particular revision:
``` Bash
svn up -r 3
```

See the differences between your working area and a revision
``` Bash
svn diff #To most recent version
svn diff -r 3
```

See what you've changed:

``` Bash
svn status
```

Get rid of changes to a file:
```
svn revert myfile.py
```

Distributed Version Control
===========================

Distributed versus centralised
------------------------------

Centralised                      Distributed
------------------               --------------
Server has history               Every user has full history
Your computer has one snapshot   Many local branches
To access history, need internet History always available
You commit to remote server      Users synchronise histories
cvs, subversion(svn)             git, mercurial (hg), bazaar (bzr)

Distributed VCS in principle

Pragmatic Distributed VCS
-------------------------

Subversion                     Git
------------------------------ ---------------
`svn checkout <URL>`           `git clone <URL>`
`svn commit`				   `git commit -a; git push`
`svn up`					   `git pull`
`svn status`                   `git status`
`svn diff`                     `git diff`

Why Go Distributed?
------------------

* Easy to start a repository (no server needed)
* Easy to start a server
* Can work without internets
* Better merges
* Easy branching
* More widespread support

Why Not Go Distributed?
-----------------------

* More complex commands
* More confusing

Distributed VCS concepts
------------------------

* Each revision has a parent that it is based on
* These revisions form a graph
* The most recent revision in each copy is the HEAD
* Each revision has a unique hash code
  * In Sue's copy, revision 43 is ab3578d6
  * Jim thinks that is revision 38
* When you *pull* from a *remote* the histories might conflict
  * Histories are *merged* together

A revision graph
----------------

![Revisions form a graph](assets/revisions)

Distributed VCS concepts (2)
----------------------------

* You have a *working copy*
* You pick a subset of the changes in your working copy
  to add to the next commit
* Changes to be included in the next commit are kept in a
  **staging area** (a.k.a. **index**)
* When you commit you commit:
  * From the staging area
  * To the local repository
* You **push** to **remote** repositories to share or publish
* You **pull** (or fetch) to bring in changes from a remote

The Levels of Git

Using Git

Distributed VCS in teams with conflicts

Working with multiple remotes
-----------------------------

``` Bash
git remote add sue ssh://sue.ucl.ac.uk/somerepo
   # Add a second remote
git remote
   # List available remotes
git push sue
   # Push to a specific remote
   # Default is origin
```

Branches
========

Working with branches
---------------------

![Using branches](assets/branching)

Working with branches in git
----------------------------

``` Bash
git branch # Tell me what branches exist
```
```
   * master # Asterisk tells me which one
     experiment # I am currently on
```
``` Bash
git checkout -b somebranch # Make a new branch
git checkout master # Switch to an existing branch
```

Sharing branches
----------------

``` Bash
git push -u origin experiment # Share a recently
                              # made branch
git push origin experiment #Republish a branch
git branch -r #Discover remote branches
git checkout origin/some_branch #Get a branch
                                #from a remote
```

Merging branches
----------------

``` Bash
git checkout master # Switch to master branch
git merge experiment # Merge the branch in
git branch -d experiment # Delete branch locally
git push --delete experiment # Delete published branch
```

A good branch strategy
----------------------

* A `production` branch: code used for active work
* A `develop` branch: for general new code
* `feature` branches: for specific new ideas
* `release` branches: when you share code with others
  * Useful for isolated bug fixes

Tagging
-------

Easy to read labels for revisions
Produce real results *only* with tagged revisions

``` Bash
git tag -a v1.3
git push --tags
```

Branching and tagging in subversion
-----------------------------------

* Subversion doesn't have real branches and tags
* Instead, each is a separate whole copy
* But you can still merge between copies

Hosting Servers
===============

Hosting a server
----------------

* Any repository can be a remote for pulls
* Can pull/push over shared folders or ssh
* Pushing to someone's working copy is dangerous
* Use `git init --bare` to make a copy for pushing
* You don't need to create a "server"

Hosting a server in the cloud
-----------------------------

* Many online services
* Github, bitbucket, sourceforge...
* I recommend GitHub
