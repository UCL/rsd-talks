The State of Research Software {.chapter-title}
================================

The SIRO Problem {.diagram2}
----------------

![](assets/SIRO.svg)

PhDWare
-------

* Don't look if anyone's done it before
* Code till it works
* Generate a figure
* Throw it away

Labware
-------

* Understood by one genius
* Implements great science, now
* FORTRAN in any language
* Code not engineered for readability
* Can't add new science

ConsultantWare
--------

* Little understanding of the science
* Overengineered
* Unmaintainable by the research group

Middleware
----------

* Generalise a part of the research problem
* Publish at an eScience conference
* Have no users in the research community

HPCWare
-------

* Get a 5% improvement in performance
* On a particular architecture
* Publish a scaling graph
* Selection against:
      * Readability
      * Maintainability
      * Adaptability

Research Software Engineers {.poster #dilstein}
----------------------------

![](assets/dilstein.png)

Research Software Engineers
----------------------------

* Not independent researchers
    * No personal research agenda
* Facilitative, supportive, and collaborative
    * Part of the academic community
    * Deep engagement with research groups

Why it works
------------

* People *want* to be RSEs
* We have been hiding as:
    * RAs who program too much
    * HPC or research group sysadmins

The movement
------------

* We need a name and some status!

<img src="assets/french-revolution-2.jpg" style="float:left;width:40%">
<div style="width:50%;float:right;margin-left:20px;">

* Measure and incentivise RSEs correctly
* Integrate RSEs within HEIs
* Support institutional innovation

</div>

RSE Groups {.chapter-title}
==========

RSE Group
---------

* Shared home for RSEs in an institution
* Both academic and Support
* "Science as a Service"

Activities
----------

* Projects
* Consulting
* Training
* Infrastructure

Domain
------

* From HPC codes to analysis scripts and infrastructure code
* From theoretical physics to digital humanities

UCL Model
------------

* All roles "permanent"
* But funded from research grant income on a pooled basis

The UCL Research Software Group
-------------------------------

<img src="assets/team.jpg" style="width:33%;float:right;">
<div style="width:65%;float:left">

* Helped UCL researchers win over Â£2M
* Grown through grant funding
* From archaeology to astrophysics

</div>

Readable, reliable, and reproducible
---------------------------------

We help make code:

* Last beyond the end of the grant that funded it
* Be usable by someone other than the PhD student who wrote it
* Have a standard of correctness better than "the graph looks about right"

Why work with RSEs? {.chapter-title}
=====================================

Clean code makes performance possible
--------------------------------

<h5>LikeLTD</h5>
<img src="assets/whodunnitdna.jpg" style="width:33%;float:right;">
<div style="width:65%;float:left">
Structural work:

* Broken down into functions
* Separate objective function from home-made optimiser
* Use standard optimiser libraries

</div>

Clean code makes performance possible
-------------------------------------

<h5>LikeLTD</h5>
<img src="assets/whodunnitdna.jpg" style="width:33%;float:right;">
<div style="width:65%;float:left">

Performance improvements:

* 4 times from moving to C
* 8 times from parallelisation
* 10 times from change of optimisation algorithm
* 300 times total

</div>			    

Engineering helps legacy code live
----------------------------------

<h5>DCProgs</h5>
<div style="width:50%; float:right;">

Before:

* Venerable Fortran
* Hasn't compiled since 2006
* Underpins Nature published research

</div>
<img src="assets/dcprogs-img1.jpg" style="width:40%;float:left;">

Engineering helps legacy code live
----------------------------------

<h5>DCProgs</h5>
<div style="width:49%; float:left;">
Our solution:

* Old code as "test oracle"
* Reimplemented in C++ and Python
* Use algorithm libraries

</div>
<div style="width:49%; float:right;">

Since then:

* ARCHER parallelisation
* MCMC inference

</div>

Reliability unlocks science
---------------------------

<h5>HemeLB Setup Tool</h5>
<div style="width:64%;float:left;">

* Voxelisation for Lattice Boltzman
* Crashed 1 time in 20
  * So tweak the origin!

</div>
<img src="assets/hemelb1.png" style="width:33%;float:right;">

Reliability unlocks science
---------------------------

<h5>HemeLB Setup Tool</h5>
<div style="width:64%;float:left;">

* Replace with standard comp geometry library
* Can handle all geometries instead of 19 in 20</li>
* Means can model changing geometries</li>

</div>
<img src="assets/hemelb1.png" style="width:33%;float:right;">

Good, huh? {.chapter-title}
==========

Lessons learned
---------------

Well, it hasn't always been pretty.

I'll try to indicate some tips and tricks learned while
creating a generalist science-as-a-service software group.

Some of these we got right. Some are things I wish I'd
known at the beginning.

RSEs and Teaching {.chapter-title}
=====================================================

Software Carpentry
------------------

<div style="width:50%;float:left">

* Intensive "bootcamp"
* Automation
* Version control
* Unit testing
* Databases

## RITS's training programme

* Software carpentry
* Data carpentry
* Introductory Python for Data Analysis
* Research Software Engineering with Python
* Research Computing with C++
* High Performance and High Throughput Computing

## Digitally native learning tools

* Web-first but classroom- and kindle-ready
    * Single source, multiple formats
* Examples which *work*:
    * Generated lecture notes from code that is *executed* and *complete*
* Open and collaborative
    * CC-BY license on notes
    * Massive cross-institutional co-creation

## Active classrooms

* Practicals and concepts together
* Bring your own device
* Post-it-notes and etherpads

## The syllabus is full.

* Ideally, *everyone* would know *everything*!
* This is clearly impossible
* So we need *division of labour*
* and enough training to work together

<h4>The Sith approach</h4>
<h4>to professional continuity</h4>
![](assets/sith.png)

Why you should have one
-----------------------

* More and more research uses software
* General programmers can't understand research
* Postdocs and PhD students don't have time to make reliable code

Why you should be one
---------------------

* Write papers
* Make code
