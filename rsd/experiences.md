Experiences in creating a Research Software Engineering Group
=============================================================

The UCL Research Software Group
-------------------------------

* Started 2012
* Helped UCL win over 1.5M in research income
* Grown from just me to a team of 8
* Works with researchers from archaeology to astrophysics

Readable, reliable, and efficient
---------------------------------

We help make code:

* Last beyond the end of the grant that funded it
* Be usable by someone other than the PhD student who wrote it
* Have a standard of correctness better than "the graph looks about right"

Good, huh?
----------

Well, it hasn't always been pretty.

In this talk, I'll try to indicate some tips and tricks learned while
creating a generalist scientific software group.

Some of these we got right. Some are things I wish I'd
known at the beginning.

Sell performance, deliver reproducibility
