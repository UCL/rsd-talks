The Craftsperson and the Scholar
--------------------------------

In this presentation, Dr James Hetherington, founding leader of the
UCL Research Software Development Team, will discuss the relationship
of software engineering best practice to the construction and
maintenance of research code. He will provide some practical tips on
tools and techniques for effective research programming, and give
examples of how the UCL team collaborates with researchers to produce
readable, reliable, and efficient scientific software addressing
problems at the forefront of knowledge.

Dr James Hetherington has fourteen years' experience as a research
programmer, both academic and industrial, in diverse fields including
physics (at Cambridge and CERN), physiology (UCL Centre for
Mathematics and Physics in the Life Sciences and Centre for
Computational Science), engineering (The MathWorks, makers of MATLAB)
and environmental sciences (AMEE, an environmental impact modelling
startup). As senior scientific innovator at AMEE, he proposed and led
development and release of AMEE Discover, an executable search engine
for models of environmental impact, winner of Popular Science
magazine's "Best of What's New" award in 2010.

The talk is available in short (25 minute) and long (1 hour) versions.
