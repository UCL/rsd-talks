The Craftsperson and the Scholar
--------------------------------

The production and maintainance of software is an important part of
research in many fields. Yet code is often lost at the end of projects,
and unusable by anyone other than the researcher who created it.
In this presentation, Dr James Hetherington, founding head of the
UCL Research Software Development Group, will discuss the relationship
of software engineering best practice to the construction and
maintenance of research code, and the effort to find a place in UK HEIs
for Research Software Engineers. He will provide some practical tips on
coding for research, and give
examples of how the UCL team collaborates with researchers to produce
readable, reliable, and efficient scientific software.

Dr James Hetherington has been working as a research programmer
programmer, both academic and industrial, for fifteen years
in diverse fields including physics (at Cambridge and CERN),
physiology (UCL Centre for Mathematics and Physics in the Life Sciences and 
Centre for Computational Science), engineering 
(The MathWorks, makers of MATLAB) and environmental sciences 
(AMEE, an environmental impact modelling startup). 

As founder of UCLâ€™s Research Software Development Group,
he has built the group through grant income since 2012 
to a team of 6, and helped create effective research software in fields from ancient
Babylonian archeology to radio astronomy and from modelling the future
of UK housing stock to brain blood flow modelling. As chair of the UK
Community of Research Software Engineers and a Fellow of the
Software Sustainability Institute, he is helping sustain the future of
the UK Research Software base.

The talk is available in short (25 minute) and long (1 hour) versions.
