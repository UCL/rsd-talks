Software is a first class research output
-----------------------------------------

UCL does a great job of promoting its traditional research outputs

UCL researchers make loads of awesome software
----------------------------------------------

For example, even just the ones we support in RSD group is a long list:

Knowing all about the software being made in UCL would be useful for research
---------------------------------------------

* Finding other people using similar tools and languages
* Finding software written in UCL which you can use
* Promoting your software to UCL users

So we made a Research Software Dashboard
----------------------------------------

It's still very early days
--------------------------

This is a beta-test release, we're looking for research groups to start to upload
software metadata to the service.

It won't show up on IRIS yet.

But wait...
-----------

We have an army of students (well, two) trained and ready to sit by you
while you upload data write down all the bugs you find.

So we'd prefer it if you didn't independently add stuff just yet: please
get in touch with [Stephen Ball](mailto:cceasba@ucl.ac.uk) if you want to try out
the site.

(Though we won't stop you.)
