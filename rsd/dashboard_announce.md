Most Researchers Make Software
------------------------------

[56% of Researchers write their own software](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-09-12-its-impossible-conduct-research-without-software-say-7-out-10-uk-researchers)

Software as a research output
-----------------------------

[Software can be a highly citable and impactful scientific output](http://www.software.ac.uk/software-credit)

UCL does a great job of promoting its traditional research outputs
-------------------------------------------------------------

[Ten Million Downloads for UCL Discovery](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/students/122016/122016-107122016-10-million-downloads-record-success-ucl-discovery/)

UCL researchers make loads of awesome software
----------------------------------------------

[Even just the projects we support in RSD group is a long list](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/research-it-services/about/research-software-development/projects)

Knowing all about the software being made in UCL would be useful for research
---------------------------------------------

* Finding other people using similar tools and languages
* Finding software written in UCL which you can use
* Promoting your software to UCL users

Software, Data and Publications: The Trinity of Reproducible Open Science
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

By associating a persistent public page for UCL-written research software, we move towards true reproducibility for computationally based research, linking the code that analysed data, the data that it processed, and the resulting research findings.

So we made a Research Software Dashboard
----------------------------------------

[https://dashboard.rc.ucl.ac.uk](https://dashboard.rc.ucl.ac.uk)

Never enter the same data twice
-------------------------------

A key design philosophy for the Dashboard was to pull in data from the UCL personnel, grants, and publications databases, and from other services such as ORCID and CCP-Forge.

You've already told UCL about your papers once, you shouldn't have to do it again when associating software with papers.
